      { q: "Will our customers be frustrated talking to a bot?", a: "Not if it's built well. We design chatbots that know their limits and escalate to humans gracefully. A bot that says 'I'm not sure, let me connect you with someone' is better than an agent who takes 48 hours to respond." },
      { q: "Can we train the bot on our specific products and policies?", a: "Yes. We ingest your knowledge base, product documentation, and policy docs using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) so the bot answers accurately about your specific products." },
      { q: "What deflection rates can we expect?", a: "Typically 40–65% of tier-1 tickets are deflected by a well-trained chatbot within the first 90 days." },
      { q: "Can it handle multiple languages?", a: "Yes. Modern LLMs handle multilingual queries natively. We configure the system to match your customer geography." },
      { q: "How long does implementation take?", a: "A basic chatbot + knowledge base takes 4–6 weeks. A fully integrated system with ticket routing and analytics takes 8–12 weeks." },

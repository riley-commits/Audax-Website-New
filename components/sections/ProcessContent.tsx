      "Every engagement starts with a structured discovery process. We interview your stakeholders, map the user journey, define the problem space, and document the precise requirements before any design or development begins. This is the highest-leverage phase: every dollar invested here saves ten in rework.",

    description:
      "With requirements locked, our design team creates wireframes and high-fidelity Figma prototypes. We design iteratively — wireframes first, then visual design, with your review and feedback at each stage. We don't write a line of code until designs are approved. This prevents the most common and costly type of rework.",

    duration: "6–16 weeks",
    description:
      "Development happens in 2-week sprints. At the end of each sprint, we demo working software to you. You can use it, test it, and give feedback. Nothing goes into the next sprint without your approval. Our engineers write tests as they build, and code is reviewed by a senior engineer before every merge.",

You get a production-grade infrastructure from day one — not something you'll need to retrofit later.",

      "Launch is the beginning, not the end. Most clients move into a retainer-based support engagement after launch: ongoing bug fixes, performance optimization, feature development based on user feedback, and strategic technical guidance. We structure retainers around your growth stage and budget.",

      "Bug fix SLA (response within 24 hours)",

const faq = [
  { q: "Do you always follow this exact process?", a: "The phases are consistent, but the durations and emphasis vary by project. A design-heavy product spends more time in UI/UX. A data-intensive platform spends more time in architecture. We adapt the process to your project, not the other way around." },
  { q: "What if requirements change mid-project?", a: "They always do. We use a lightweight change management process: small changes are absorbed in the current sprint; significant scope changes are re-estimated transparently, with your approval required before we proceed." },
  { q: "How often do we communicate?", a: "Weekly video calls, asynchronous Slack communication, and bi-weekly sprint demos. You'll never wonder what's happening — and you'll never wait more than 2 weeks to see working software." },
  { q: "Can we start development before design is complete?", a: "Sometimes. For large projects, we structure work so development of completed designs can begin in parallel with design of later features. But we never build without approved designs for the specific features being built." },
  { q: "What does the discovery phase cost?", a: "Discovery is priced as a fixed-fee sprint: $5,000–$9,000 depending on complexity. This is separate from the development engagement and produces everything you need to get an accurate development estimate from any agency." },
